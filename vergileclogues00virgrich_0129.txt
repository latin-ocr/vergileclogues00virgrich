ECLOGUE 1. 3

shall lift 1115 song to heaven. And still meanwhile the
hoarse wood-pigeons‚ your delight‚ and the turtle-dove shall
not weary of cooing from the lofty elm.

ΤΙΤ. Sooner, therefore, shall the nimble stags pasture in
the ocean and the seas leave the fishes bare upon the shore,
sooner shall the Parthians or the Germans, roaming each
over the othei-'s borders, 0110 drink the Arar’s waters 111
exile, the other Tigris' stream, than his face shall slip from
my heart.

64. MEL. Yet some of us shall go hence to the thirsty
Asticans, and some shall come to Scythia and to chalk-rolling
Oaxes and to the people of Britain, wholly cut off from all
the world. Oh, shall I ever, when I behold, a long time
hereafter, my country’s borders and the turs-thatched roof
of my poor cottage, my old domain, hereafter gaze with
wonder on a few ears of corn? A godless soldier shall possess
your well-tilled ploughlands, a barbarian these crops of
yours. Oh, to what a state has civil discord dragged our
’ wretched citizens3 for such men as these we have sown our
fields! Go to, now, graft your pear trees, Meliboeus; set
your vines in rows. Go forth, my goats‚ my once happy
herds, go forth! Never hereafter shall Ι, as Ι 110 at length
in a mess-grown cave, behold you in the distance hanging
from some thioket—clad steep3 no songs shall I sing; not
with me to tend you shall ye browse 011 the fiowering lucerne
and bitter willow leaves.

ΤΙΤ. still, you might have rested here this night with me
upon the green leaves ; Ι have ripe apples, mealy chestnuts,
and a goodly store of cheese. And now the roofs of the
farmhouses are smoking yonder, and larger grow the shadows
that are falling from the lofty mountainS.
