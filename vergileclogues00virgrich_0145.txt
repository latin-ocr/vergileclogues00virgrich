set up in full length all wrought of polished marble, thine
ankles gii-t with purple buskins.

THYR. A bowl of milk and cakes like these are enough
for 11106 10 look for year by year, Priapus z the garden thou
protectest is poor. At present to suit my means I'll make
thee a statue of marble3 but if the younglings fill up 1116
1616 of our herds, thou shalt be wrought in gold.

37. COR.. Galatea, child of the sea-god, sweeter to me than
1116 thyme of Hybla, whiter than any swan, fairer than
pale ivy, as soon as ever the bullooks come back from the
pastures 10 their 516115, if thou hast any care for thy Corydon,
oh come 1

THYR. N ay, may I seem 10 11166 more bitter than
Sardinian herbs, rougher than broom, more worthless than

THYR. The field is parched 3 the grass is athirst and
dying in the poisoned air. The wine god has begrudged
the 111115 1116 shade of their vines: but 61 my Phyllis'
