Eclogue II. In this Eclogue the shepherd Corydon
makes his complaint about the unkindness of Alexis, his
master's favourite slave.

Eclogue III. This Eclogue is a specimen of a rustic
singing-match, or carmen amoebaeum. Menalcas and
DamoetaS, two rival shepherds, meet and challenge each
other to contend in singing for a wager, choosing Palaemon
for their umpire. Damoetas begins with a pair of hexa-
meters, and his rival replies with a pair to match them, and

so they go on till Palaemon declares the match drawn.
Eclogue IV. This famous poem heralds the new age

that is to be ushered in by the birth of a certain Child.
<For some of the conjectures as to who the Child is, see
the preface to the notes on the Eclogue, p. 57.) Iu
this new age all work is to cease and the earth of her-
self is ‘co provide food for mankind, as in the mythical
Golden A e.

Eclogueg V. Two shepherds, Menalcas aud Mopsus,
meet and agree to sing in alternate lays their laments
for Daphnis, their dead shepherd-friend. Mopsus sings
of Daphnis' death and of the sorrow he has left behind
him3 Menalcas of his exaltation to heaven, and of the
joy which has followed the former sorrow. This is not
exactly a formal singing-match, though the shepherds
intel-change gifts at the end of their lays.

Eclogue VI. This Eclogue is largely allegorical. It is
probably an answer to the request of Alfenus Varus for
a poem celebrating his warlike exploits. Vergil excuses
himself on the plea that Apollo had warned him to confine
himself to humbler themes, and asks Varus to accept a
pastoral lay, describing how two shepherds caught Silenus
and madc him sing to them a song containing an account
of the creation and many famous myths.

Eclogue VII. This, with ΙΙΙ. and V., are the only three
genuine singing-matches among the Eclogues. Here a
goatherd Meliboeus describes a match he had witnessed
between Thyrsis and Corydon, with Daphnis for umpire.
They sing in turn of their country gods and their loves and
their flocks, and the sympathy of all nature around them.
