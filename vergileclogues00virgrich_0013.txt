ξ 1. ΡυΒΙᾸῦε Visne-imus MARo was born on October15th‚
70 13.o., at Andes, near Mantua, a town in Cisalpine Gaul,
north of the Padus (Po). His parents were
at first in very humble circumstances, but
the father increased his substance by keeping
bees and buying up tracts of woodland, and contrived
to send his son as a student first to Cremona, then
to Mediolanum (Milan), and finally to Rome. Of his
teachers the Epicurean Siron, whose lectures he attended
at Rome, seems to have exercised especial influence upon
him. The even tenor of the student's quiet life appears
not to have been broken until, in 42 B.o. or shortly
afterwards, his father's lands were seized and assigned to
some of Octavianus' veterans. It seems clear that the
lands were restored through the aid of some influential
friends of the poet, such as Pollio, Gallim, and Alfenus
Varus; but it is doubtful whether they were again seized,
as some authorities assert. After these events Vergil
lived partly at Rome and partly at his villa near Nola in
Campania, which he probably acquired through the in-
fiuence of Gaius Cilnius MaecenaS‚ Augustus' chief adviser,
and a well—known patron of literary men. His tenderness
and amiability, his high sense of honour and devotion to
his art, made him a favoni-ite in the brilliant literary circle
which the Emperor collected around him. He is said to
have been tall and pale, with a somewhat rustic cast of
features. His health was variable, and he died a com-
paratively young man, at Brundisium (Brindisi) in Calabria,
on September 22nd‚ 19 B.O., having just returned from a
tour in Greece. The body was carried to Naples, near
which town a monument is still shown as Vergil's tomb.
Upon it is inscribed the famous epitaph :—

Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nune
Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.
