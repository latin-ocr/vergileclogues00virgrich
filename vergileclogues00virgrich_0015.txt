Nisus ; (3) the Moretum (Salad), a poem on peasant life.

· ᾧ 3. The origin of pastoral poetry is obscure, but it is clear
that it was first brought into prominence, if not actually
P t l created, as a distinct species of poetry in Sicily,
13ng by the Greek poet Theocritus. He was a native
either of Syracuse or Oos, and spent some years

at Alexandria, where he studied under Philetas and obtained
the patronage of Ptolemy Soter and his son, but resided
during the greater part of his life in Sicily. Theocritus'
Idffls are the most valuable product of· the Alexandrian
literature which fiourished under the Ptolemies of the third
century B.o. Among the learned and laborious versifiers
of Alexandria he stands out as a true poet, with a genius
for painting scenes of shepherd life, as the only writer
among them, says Professor Jebb, ‘⁴ who has a true affinity
with the great past of Greek song.⁷' The names by which
his poems are called, εἰδύλλια, εἴδη, correctly indicate their
character as “ pictures ⁷² of country life. Deriving perhaps
some of his materials from the songs which Sicilian
shepherds sang at rustic festivals, and from the mimes of
Sophron and others, Theocritus produced a series of rustic
pictures in verse, which were intended by their author to be
works of art, and not mere photographic representations of
country life3 and as pictures of nature and life amid nature's
fairest scenes, they have never lost their charm. Of the
thirty poems which have come down to us as TheOcritus'
Idylls, some are not his, and six are not pastorals, but
poems on Epic subjects, written more in the style of the
Alexandrian poets. Only in a few cases, however, can be
traced that allegorica] representation of real characters
under feigned shepherd names which is practised so fre-

’ quently by Vergil and other imitators of the Theocritean

pastoral. There are still extant a few pastoral poems of
Theocritus' two contemporaries, Bion and Moschus, who
sometimes imitated but never surpassed the great master
of bucolic poetry. With the pocms of Theocritus in dialogue
