ECLOGUE ΠΙ.

PREFACE.

We have in this Eclogue a specimen of a ear-men amoebaemn (Gk.
ἀμοιβαίη ἀοιδά, a set of alternating verses, sung by two persons one in
answer to the other), a rustic singing-match‚ in which two rival
shepherds, Menalcas and Damon, meet and challenge one another to
contend for a stake‚ choosing as their judge Palaemon. Thc Eclogue
is largely' based on the fifth and in a less degree on the fourth

Idyll of Theocritus.
