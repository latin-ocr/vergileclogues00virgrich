24. potuisse videri: lit. “ that you are s( en to ha xe been able ” ;

titive genitive is often used thus for an adjective and noun (eg. alia
mereat).

31. Here follows a short account of the Creation, chiefly from
Lucretius. In the beginning was a void (inane), which was filled
with atoms. By fortuitous concourses of these atoms was gradually
formed the universe and all that is therein. inane: “void.” The
neuter of the adjective is used as a substantive.

32. fuissent: subjunctive in indirect question depending on uti.
Similarly is to be explained the mood of concreverit (v. 34) and
stupeant, etc. (v. 37, etc.). As the sequence is secondary after
canebat, we should expect secondary tenses of the subjunctive to
follow in all cases, but Vergil changes to primary tenses for vivid
and varied effect.

33. liquidi. . . ignis: this is what Lucretius calls liquidissimus
aether or iynifeo· aether, the subtle fluid which is found beyond the
denser aimosphere (aer) of the earth. †his ex omnia primis: i.e.
ew his primis, prima being used for Lucretius' primordia, “primal
elements.'’ A v. Ζ. is excordia, “ origins,’' “ beginnings.’'

34. tener muudi . . . orbis: either (1) “ the elastic globe of aether
had grown into a whole‚'' or better (2) “ the young globe of earth and
sky grew into a whole.’' Mundus is sometimes used of the whole
ifimiverse, as in (2), and sometimes, as in (1), of the (fiery) aether or

rmament.

35. durare: probably intransitive, solum being the subject of
coeperit. Others take it as transitive, making orbis the subject of
eoeperit. discludere Nerea ponto: “shut Nereus apart in the sea,’'

from a greater height now that the clouds are raised.” This gives
the best sense, but the position of atque is very unusual: hence
some omit the comma after solem and put one after altius, translating
“ higher than before,'' 01· “at a higher elevation (than the clouds).''
