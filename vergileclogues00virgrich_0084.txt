78 EcLerE lx.

10. vestrum Menalcan ι “your Menalcas.'' Vester cannot refer to
a single person, so that it refers here to both Moeris and his fellow-
slaves.

13. Chaonias: lit. “ of the Chaones‚'' a people of Epirus 3 hence
“of Dodona‚’' in Epirus, where there was an oracle of Zeus in a
grove of oaks. It is a literary epithet. See Ι. 54, η.

14. quod: “but‚’' lit. “in view of which fact‚'‘ an accusative of
limitation or reference used as a conjunction. quacunque: supply
ratione possem, “by whatever means Ι could.’' incidere: “to cut
through,’' ‘⁶ cut short,” ‘⁶ settle.”

15. sinistra cornix: we lea-rn from Cicero that the appearance of a
raven on the left was an important omen.

16. nec viveret ipse Menalcas t “nor would your master Menalcas
here be living.'’ The imperfect, as is usual in conditional sentences of
this class, refers to present time.

Vv. 17-29. LYC. Was Menalzccs so nearly las-t to ‘et-5⁸? Ah, ‘ch he
had been, wlco would sing] us such son-qs as MS “ Timo-us '' ,Ρ MOER.
OJ· as his ‘⁴ Varas’² ,Ρ

17. cadit in quemquam . . . scelus} “can such guilt belong to
any man?” Cadere in aliquem is a common phrase in CicerQ
meaning “to square with? “belong to any one.” nobis: dative of
disadvantage with rapta, “torn away to our injury,·'' “torn away
from uS.” tua solacia: w. “ the comfort you bring us.”

19. caneret : potential subjunctive, like §partlm-et, induceret, v. 20.
Vergil is alluding to Eclogue V. 20, 40. Observe the different con-
structions with induco here and V. 40. Here induco is used in an
extended sense, “to cover.'’

21. quae sublegi tacitus tibi: the full construction would be vel
(quis caneret ea) quae, etc. Note the force of sub„ “in secret,'' like
ὑπο· in Greek. Tibiis dative of disadvantage. Translate, ¹‘ Ι gathered
up in secret from you,'' as you sang them.

22. delicias nostras: “our darling'' ς cp. amm-es, “a loved one.”

23. dum redeo . . . pasce : “until I return‚'’ etc. 3 the regular prose
,construction would be dum redeam3 but here we have the indica-
tive with dum, “ until‚” as often in the comic poeis. Some, however,
translate, “while Ι am on my way back.'' This, however, seems
unnecessary‚ and it does not suit the context so well. Tacitus must
be translated by an adverb, “ silently.'’

24. inter agendum : “ while driving.”

25. occursare: poetical use of the infinitive with caveto. The
prose construction would be eave ne occurses.

26. immo : an emphasising particle sometimes meaning “yes,' as
here, and sometimes “ no.'' necdum ε equivalent to nondum.

27. superet modo: subjunctive of wish, modified by modo, lit.
