14 VERGIL.

to thy own ἒ Lo, here are four altars 3 see, there are two for
thee, Daphnis, and two as high-altars to Phoebus! Each
year will I set for thee two cups foaming with new milk
and two bowls of rich olive oil, and, above all, gladdening
the feast with Bacchus’ store—before the fire, if it be
the winter, if harvest tide, in the shade 3 I will pour from
goblets the fresh nectat· of Ariusian wineS. Damoetas and
Aegon of Lyctus, shall sing for me, Alphesiboeus shall ’
give imitations of the danoing satyrs. These honours shalt
thou always have, both when we pay our wonted VQWS. to
the nymphs and when We purify the fields. So long as the
boar shall love the mountain topS, so long as the fish shall
love the rivers, and so long as bees shall feed on thyme and
cicalas on dew, so long shall thine honour, thy fame, and
thy glory ever abide. Even as to Bacchus and Ceres, so
unto thee shall the peasants year by year pay their vows3
thou too shalt condemn men to pay their vows.

81. MOP. What gifts shall 1 give thee for so noble a
lay? For neither the whistling of the rising south wind
nor the beating of the surge on the seashore give me such
delight, no, nor the streams that run down the middle of
the rocky glens.

ΜΕΝ. First I will present thee with this frail reed3 this
taught me “ Corydon was burning with love for fair
Alexis '²3 this also taught me ‘⁶ VVhose fiock is this‘.2 Does
it belong to Meliboeus 2 '⁷

ΜΟΡ. But do you take this shepherd's orook, which
Antigenes did not get from me, although he asked me often
—in those days he deserved to be loved-—a fine one it is,
with regular knots, and tipped with bronze, Menalcas.
