48 ECLOGUE 1.

his veins swell ;'’ latus fultus, “having supported his side ;’' crines
ornatus, “having adorned (for himself) his locks;’' saras evineta,
“having bound (for herself) her legs.'' [The distinction between
the two is seen by noting that in induitur qalea‘m the hero himself
puts on his helmet, but in florem, depasta not the hedge but the bees
suck the fiower of the willow.] From the foregoing constructions
must be distinguished the accusative of respect or extent ε aq. nuda
flente, ‘⁶ naked as to her knee 3 ’⁹ sancia pectus, “wounded in (lit. as to)
the breast’'; Cressa qenns Pholoe, “Pholoe‚ a Cretan woman as to
race.” In prose the construction of the perfect participle governing
an accusative is replaced by the ablative of attendant circumstances
(ablative absolute); aq„ inflatis venis would be used for ‘inflatus
venas, latere fulto for latus saltus. The prose equivalent for the
accusative of respect is the ablative of respect.

55. susurro : the ‘⁴ humming '’ of the bees.

56. ad auras : in Vergil, as here, often means “to the sky.”

59. ante : this is taken up by ante, v. 61, and answered by quam,
v, 63. † in aequore : “in the ocean ;'’ V.l. in aethere.

61. pererratis amborum finibus: “roaming over each the other’s
borders’'; i.e. the Parthian will migrate to Germany and the German
to Parthia.

63. labatur: the subjunctive is used after antequam if the action
expressed by the clause is purposely anticipated. vultus: tle. Octavi-
anus’ gracious look when he granted Tityrus’ prayer.

Vv. 64—83. MEL. But we shall have to wander on to distant lands
and never more see my home. Civil war· llas given myfarm. to the
spoilers. All ‘my toiZ was wasted. I shall know ease and happiness
no more. TIT. Stin, you. miqht as well spend the ⁷222an with me and

64. Afros: the preposition of “motion to'’ is regularly omitted in
prose before names of towns and small islands3 here it is omitted, by
poetic licence‚ before the name of a people, cp. Britannos, v. 66.
Similarly with Scythiam and Oaoeen.

65. †rapidum cretae veniemus Oaxen: “we shall come to chalk-
rolling Oaxes.'' Rapidus here has an active force, “ hurrying‚”
“rolling‚’' and cretae is obJ‘ective genitive. By Oaa’es Vergil
probably means the Oxus; but geography is not a strong point with
him. It is unnecessary to read. (2) Cretae for cretae, though there is
a small river of that name in Crete, or (3) certe . . ad Oxum. Oaoees
represented the farthest north-east as Britanni the farthest north-
west to Vergil’s mind.
