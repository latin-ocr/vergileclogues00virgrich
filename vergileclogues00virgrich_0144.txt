THE SEVENTH EGLOGUE.

1. MELIBOEUS. Daphnis one day had chanced 130 seat
himself beneath a whispering holm-oak, and Corydon and
Thyrsis had driven their fiocks together to one spot—Thyrsis
the sheep, Corydon the goats, now swollen with milk. Both
were in the fiower of their years, Arcadi-ans both, well
matched in song, and ready to reply. To this spot even my
he-goat, the lord of the herd, had wandered off, while I was
protecting the young myrtles from the frost. When lo ! I

THYRSIS. Ye shepherds, deck your rising poet with ivy,
Shepherds of Arcadia, that 50 Codrus' sides may burst with
jealousy3 or, should he praise me beyond what is fitting,
