EOLOGUE V.

PRE FAcE.

In this Eclogue Vergil chiefly follows Theocritus* first Idyll. It
is probable that by the apotheosis of Daphnis Vergil is allegorical] y
celebrating the deification of the Dictator Caesar, and that the
Eclogue was written in 42 B.C., in which year it was decreed, in
honour of Caesar, that the name of the month Quintilis should be
changed to Julius, and that his birthday should be publicly cele-
brated. The poem describes a singing-match between two shepherds,
one of whom sings os: the death, the other of the apotheosis, of
Daphnis (the ideal shepherd).

Vv. 1—19. MENALCAS. Come, levus sit ltere and sinq. MOPSUS. Ite,
Cloe skade of clia trees, 02· in the eave, shall it be? ΜΕΝ. Only
Amyntas ean rival you. MOP. Or rival Phoebus? ΜΕΝ. Yon
heym, thren, ancl stay ⁰f love, ον noble deeds, 01· strife. MOP. Nay,
ltere is a song] .· Zet us see if Amyntas ean, suo-pass it. ΜΕΝ. Amyntas

1. boni . . . inflare . . . dicere: for the use of the infinitive cp.
iv. 54, n. Here the infinitive is equivalent to a locative case or a
dative of work contemplated. When used thus with adjectives it is
usually called a prolative, epexegetic, or complementary infinitive,
because it “carries on‚'’ “ explains '' or “ completes ’' the sense of the
adjective. Here it explains in what direction the skill is shown.
Other instances of this construction are soli eantare per-iti Arcades,
“Arcadians alone are skilled in song ;'' niveus videri, “snow-white
in appearance ; ” cantari difflues, ⁴⁶ worthy to be sung ;'' nescia vinei
pectora, ‘⁴ breasts knowing not how to be conquered.'’

3. consedimus: an imitation of a Greek use of the aorist. We
might expect eonsidimus (present of consido), but there is no need to
alter consedimus.

4. maior: τῖε. the elder. parere, “to obey,'' should be distinguished
from parere, “to bring forth,'’ and parare, “to prepare.’'

6. succedimus: as here, so in good prose, succedere takes either
the dative (eg. antro) or a preposition (sub) and the accusative.

7. sparsit : for the indicative after adspice, ut, sec iv, 52, n.

9. si certet: the apodosis (result clause) must be inferi-ed, “what
(would you say) if he werc to contend? ’' The line is ironical:
Mopsus means that Amyntas has as much chance of beating Apollo
as of beating him.

10. Phyllidis ignes : ie. ‘⁶ passionate love-songs about Phyllis‚‘’ the
genitive being obJective, as also are Alconis and Codri in v. ll. We
have here merely four shepherd names.

14. modulans alterna notavi: “ and I set them to music marking
