ECLOGUE VI.

PREFACE.

Alfenus Varus, to whom this poem is addressed‚ was consul suffectus,
39 B.C., and succeeded Pollio as governor of Cisalpine Gaul. Vergil
seems to have intended to celebrate Varus' warlike deeds, a task
which we may suppose he gave up partly because he felt it beyond
him, and partly because he considered it would be indiscreet to write
on contemporary wars. Silenus’ song in2 this Eclogue shows how
strongly Vergil was influenced by Lucretius, whose poem De Rerum·
Natam had recently been published.
