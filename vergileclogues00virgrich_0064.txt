5 8 EGLOGUE 1v.

in the Hebrew prophete (especially Isaiahl, with whose writings Vergil
may have been acquainted‚ has led to the supposition that the main idea
of the Eclogue—-the connection between the return of the Golden Age

Hexameters which were said to have been purchased by Tarquin

Alexandrian sources ultima aetas: Vergil is here probably thinking
of a Sibylline prophecy that there should be a succession of ten saecula,
of which the last should be under the rule 01 Apollo. This idea is
blended with the theory of the Annus Maqnus or Platonicus, a long
period which, it was supposed, would be completed when the planets
had come back to the places they held in the beginning. On its
completion‘a new era 01 Annus Maynus would begin. This era is
described as magnus . . . ordo (v. 5). With these tvm theories is
blended the ancient idea, found in Hesiod‚ of four ages having
existed since the Creation—the golden, the silver, the brass, and the
