4. mutata . . . cursus: “rivers changed and lullcd their flow to
rest.” Mutata is explained by suos requierunt cursus. Reqnesserunt
is here perhaps transitive, though such a usage is rare. Some take

in a middle sense, “the rivers with their courses changed sank to
‘rest,” te. the courses of the rivers were changed (or stopped) and

they became motionleSS.

Aquileia, in North Italy.

7. oram Illyrici legis aequoris: leym-e, as a nautical term, means
