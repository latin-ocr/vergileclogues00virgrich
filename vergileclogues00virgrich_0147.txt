Ecnoeun vm. 21

is ever tuneful, his pines ever vocal, and alway he listens
to shepherds' loves and to Pan, who first would not suffer
the reeds to be idle. Begin with me, my pipe, Arcadian
strainS. To Mopsus is Nysa given: what may we lovers
not-expect [l Griffins shall now mate with horses, and in the
succeeding age timid deer shall come with hounds to drink.
Mopsus, cut thou fresh torches, it is thou who art taking
her to wife. Bridegroom, fling thou nuts about: for thee
the evening star is quitting Oeta. Begin with me, my pipe,
Arcadian strains. O wedded wife of a worthy spouse, while
thou scornest all, and while thou loathest my pipe, and my
goats t00, and my shaggy brow and long-grown heard, and
dost not believe that any god has regard for mortal’s doings.
Begin with me, my pipe, Arcadian strains. Yet in our
orchard when thou wast but a girl I saw thee—I was
showing thee the way—gathering dewy apples with thy
mother. At that time I had already entered on my twelfth
year : I could already reach from the ground to the boughs
that were easy to break. 41. When I saw, how I was
undone! What evil madness hurried me away! Begin
with me, my pipe, Arcadian strains. Now I know what
manner of deity is Love: on rough rocks he was born of
Tmaros or Rhodope or the Garamentes at the world’s end,
he is no son of our race or blood. Begin with me, my pipe,
Arcadian strains. Oruel Love taught a mother to imbrue
her hands in her children’s blood, cruel wert thou too, O
mother, a cruel mother 1311011, but that boy· god was mole
wantonly wicked.) Wantonly wicked was that boy god3

crue] wert too, mother! Beg <rin with me, my pipe,
Arcadian strains. Now let the wolf, of his own accmd,
fiee even from sheep, let the tough oaks bear golden apples,
let the alder bloom with narcissus, let rich amber ooze
from the tamarisk's bark, let screech-owls vie even with
Δ swans, and let Tityrus become Orpheus‚—Orpheus in the
woods, among the dolphins Arion. Begin with me, my
pipe, Arcadian strains. Let all things, an thou wilt, become
the deep sea. Farewell, ye woods 5 headlong from the
watch tower on the lofty cliff into the waves I shall plunge ;
take this as my last dying gift. Oease, my pipe, cease at
last Arcadian strains.
