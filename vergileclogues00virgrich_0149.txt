Betooun 1x. 23

the city, my spells, bring Daphnis home. 101. Bear ashes
out of doors, Amaryllis, and cast them. into the running
stream and over your head, and look not back. By these
means Ι will assai] Daphnis3 naught cares he for the gods,
naught for spells. Bring home from the city, my spells,
bring Daphnis home. See, even of themselves, the ashes
have caught the altar with flickering flames, while I was
slow in taking them up. Be it a good omen. There is
something of a surety, and Hylax is barking *on the
threshold. Are we to believe it 2 or do lovers fancy dreams
for themselves? Cease—from the city he is coming--now
cease, my· spells—Daphnis comes·

THE NINTH EOLOGUE.

1. LYCIDAS. Whither are you turning your footsteps,
Daphnis? I suppose it's whither the road leads—to the
city 2

MOERIS. O Lycidas, we have lived to hear a stranger—
a blow we never apprehended—in possession of our little
farm, saying: “These lands are mine ; you old tenants,
remove elsewhere.'' Now, defeated and sorrowful, for
chance turns all things upside down, we are taking these
kids to market for him—bad luck to him ἒ

LYO. Well, I at any rate had heard that all the land
where the hills begin to withdraw, as they let the ridge
sink down with gentle slope, right down to tfflountain
and to the old beeches with their now shattered tops——all
this-your Menalcas had saved by his songs.

MOER. You had heard, and so the story went ; but my
songs, Lycidas, avail among weapons of war only as much as
Chaonian doves, so the proverb runs, at the eagle's approach.
But had not a crow on the left warned me from a hollow
holm—oak to settle this new quarrel as best I might, neither
your friend Moeris ‘here nor Menalcas himself would be
living.

17. LYO. Ah Ξ can such guilt belong to any man ’.ἱ Ah !
has the comfort you bring us been so nearly stolen from us
