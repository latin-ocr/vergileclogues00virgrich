ECLOGUE I.

PREFACE.

The pastoral style and seenery of the first Eologue really serve as
a dress for Vergil’s own thoughts on some of his personal experienoes
These thoughts are artistieally interwoven with purely imaginary
associations ; for though Tityrus is Virgil’s mouthpiece occasionally,
his strains, like those of his friend Meliboeus, are chiefly coneerned
with the conventional subjects of shepherds' song. The poem
was intended to be an expression of gratitude to Octavianus for
restoring to Vergil his father’s farm at Andes, near Mantua, which
had fallen into the hands of the veterane who had fought for the
Triumvirs at Philippi (42 B.C.).

It was shortly after 42 B.O. that Vergil recovered his farm and
composed this enduring record of his gratitude.
