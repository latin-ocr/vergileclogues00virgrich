8 INTRODUCTION.

ξ 2. Vergil's fame as a poet rests on three great works:
the EcloqueS, the Georyics, and the Aeneid. The Ecloyues
(Bucolica or Ecloqae) are ten short poems in
the pastoral style of which the Sicilian poet
Theocritus was the most celebrated master among the
Greeks. The Ecloyues were written before 38 B.0. Like all
the great works of Vergil, they are in hexameter verse (ξ 8),
into which Vergil introduced a smoothness and harmony of
rhythm unequalled by any Roman poet. The novelty of the
subject and beauty of the verse secured for the Ecloyues
immediate and lasting popularity.

An enthusiastic lover of the country, Vergil readily
acceded to Maecenas' request for a poem on rural life. His
Θεωρίας (Georyica) form a didactic poem in four Books, and
are based upon the Worlcs cmd Πῶρε of Hesiod, the Phaeno-
mena and Diosemez'co of Aratus, the Georyica of Nicander, and
the works of other Greek and Roman writers on agriculture.
The four Books were written 37 -30 B.c. ; they deal respect-
ively with agriculture, the culture of trees, the breeding,
etc„ of cattle and horses, and bee-farming, matters which
Vergil's wide reading and practica] experience enabled him
to treat with thorough knowledge, while adorning them
with all the beauty that could be lent to them by a great
poet with an enthusiastic love of his theme.

The Aeneicl (Aeneis), Vergil's most famous work, was the
product of the ten last years of his life. It is an epic
poem, in which the fortunes of Aeneas, after the fall of
Troy, are taken as a foundation for the poet’s splendid
description of the growth of Rome's greatneSS, until at last
she reached the summit of her glory in the reign of
Augustus, the greatest of Aeneas' line. Though the
exquisite skill of Vergil could never surpass the unconscious
art of his unapproachable model, Homer, he has neverthe-
less produced a national epic, which won the enthusiastic
admiration of his contemporaries, and has never ceased to
be read and studied as one of the greatest works of human
gemus.

Certain minor poems are attributed to Vergil on question-
able authority. They are: (1) the Culex (Gnat), a Bucolic
poem 3 (2) the Giris, or the story of Scylla, the daughter of

His works.
