ECLOGUE IX.

PREFAOE.

This poem consists of a dialogue between two shepherdS, Moeris, a
servant of Menalcas (vae. Vergil), and Lycidas. Moeris tells of
Menalcas’ ejection from his farm; Lycidas consoles him, and they
repeat selections of Menalcas' poetry.

Much of it comes from Theocritus' seventh Idyll.

The same subject is referred to here as in the first Eclogue (see
Preface) 3 but it is doubtful whether this Eclogue was written before
or after the first. If before, then Eclogue IX. contains the com·
plaint about the confiscation ot Vergil's farm; Eel-›gue I. is an
expression of gratitude for its restoration. If Eclogue IX. was
written after Eclogue I., then we must suppose that Vergil's farm had
been given back to him by Octavianus, and that on his attempting
to take possession, the soldier colonist who held it made a violent
resistance. The Eclogue appears to be intended as an appeal to

Alfenus Varus for help and protection (cp. VV. 26-29).
