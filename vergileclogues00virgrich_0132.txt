THE THIRD EoLoouE.

1, MENALCAS. Tell me, DamoetaS, whose fiock is this?
Does it belong to Meliboeus?

DAMOETAS. No, to Aegon3 Aegon handed them over to
my care just now.

MEN. Poor sheep, always a luckless flock! While your
master is wooing Neaera, and is afraid of her showing more

the ewes twice every hour, and so the life-juiee is filched

mine, Damon himself confessed it, but said he could not
<rive it to me.
ὃ ΜΕΝ You beat him at playing2 Or did you ever have a
1¹eed·pipe jointed with wax? You dolt, weren't you in the
habit of murdering, at the cross-ways, some unfortunate
lay on a grating straw 2
