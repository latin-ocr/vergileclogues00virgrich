THE SIXTH EoLOGUE.

1. At first my muse deigned to sport in Syracusan 51316111,
‘nor blushed to dwell in ‘che woods. When I essayed to
sing of kings and batffles, 13116 Cynthian god touched my
ear and reminded me, saying‚ “ Α shepherd, Tityrus, should
see 111613 13116 sheep he feeds are fab and 13116 501185 he 511185
are 1311111.” So now—since you will find plenty of poets eager
130 tell of your glorious deeds and sing of your sorrow-
fraughb wars--I will 0011 6 11151310 melody on a slender pipe
of reed. Non unbidden is the strain Ι sing. Yeb if anyone,
despite their feebleness‚ if anyone should read even 1311656
verses charmed with fond 10176 for them, you, Varus, shall
be sung of by my bamarisks and all my grove; nor does
Phoebus take more 1161181113 111 any page than the one which
bears ab its head the name of Varus,

13. Press on, ye Pierian maids. Chromis and Mnasylos,
two young shepherds, saw Silenus lying asleep in a 06176,
1115 1761115 5117011611, 65 bhey ever are, with yes'uerday's carouse 3
the garlands had slipped from his head, and were lying just-
a 11131316 'way off, and in 1115 1161111 1115 heavy stoup was 116118-
1118 by its well-worn handle. Up they oome-—for 13116 0101
man 6116613611 both of 13116111 01113 of a promised song—and
throw upon him chains made of 1115 own garlands. To their
aid comes Aegle, and finds them half afraid, Aegle, 13116
faires‘o of the Naiads 3 and as 116 begins 130 open his eyes,
painbs his face and temples wi‘nh blood-red mulberries.
Laughing 613 13116 1011011, quoth 116, “ Why are you weaving
chains2⁷' Set me free, boys3 11315 enough for your power

shall be my songs‚ hers a reward of another kind! With
1311613 116 begins 613 once. Then, 611, bhen fawns and beasts
»of 13116 foresb 1111181113 have been seen danoing in measured
time, while the sturdy oaks swayed 1311611· 13οΡ5 130 and fro.
Nob so much does Parnassus’ peak rejoice in Phoebus, nor
so much do Rhodope and Ismarus marvel 613 Orpheus.
