§ 8. Α syllable contains either one vowel or a diphthong 3
any syllable containing a diphthong or long
vowel is a long syllable, and a syllable con-
taining a short vowel is a short syllable unless two
consonants (see Rule 3, below) follow the vowel. Thus, 63,
“ bone,'' has genitive ossis, in which the first syllable is
long on account of the position of o before 33, although the
ο 13 naturally short, as is seen by the nominative.

The following rules are sufficient for the learner's guida nce
in reading verse, but are nearly all subject to some few
exceptions :—-

(1) A diphthong or contracted syllable is long; (3.9.
mensa-c, nil (= travail).

(2) The former of two vowels not forming a diphthong is
short 5 ay. puer.

(3) A syllable is long when its vowel is followed in the
same word by two consonants (other than lz), by one of the
double consonants x, z, or by semi-consonant ’ἱ (sometimes

rinted “ .
p (4) Ansina] syllable ending in a consonant counts as long
before a word beginning with a semi-consonant i or a con·
sonant (other than h).

(5) A syllable containing a vowel naturally short is either
long or short when the vowel is followed by two different
consonants of which the second is ἰ or r3 ay. petto-{3 or Ῑοᾶιξνῖὲ,
gen. sing. of pater. (A vowel by nature long remains long3
(3.9. Ίηᾶινῖε, gen. sing. of mater.)

(6) Final syllables of words ending in a, i, o, u, as, es, os,
and c, are long. Final a, however, in nom„ voc„ and acc„
is short. Final es is short in such nominatives singular as
miles, and in the nom. plural of Greek substantiveS, aq.
lampadas 3 and final as is short in the corresponding Greek
geo. plural, lampa‘dds. Final os is short when it represents

reek -ὄ3,

(7) Final e is short except in the lst (Greek) and 5th
declensions‚ in 2nd sing. imper. act. of verbs of the an
conjugation‚ and in adven-bs,

Prosody.
