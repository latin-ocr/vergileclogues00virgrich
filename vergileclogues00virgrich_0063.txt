ECLOGUE IV.

PREFAOE.

The date of this poem is shown by the reference to Pollio’s
consulship (v. 11) to be 40 ΒΕ. In this year he in conjunction
with Maecenas had negotiated the treaty of Brundusium, by which
the peace of the Roman World seemed likely to be once more firmly
established. It seems clear that Vergil is endeavouring to describe
more or less allegorically the blessings that might be looked for
in the new era of peace. He speaks of a child who is to set up
this new kingdom and be its king. Who this child is remains an
unsolved problem3 but it seems most probable that Vergil meant
(l) the looked-for son of Octavianus and Scribonia. Others identify
the child with (2) the expected son of M. Antonius and Octavia,
(3) one of Pollio’s sons, (4) Rome, i.e. the Roman people cossectively,
the new generation of Rome.
