ECLOGUE X.
PREFACE.

This Eclogue has for its subject the disappointed love of O. Cornelius
Gallus, the well-known poet and soldier. A partisan of Octavius, hc
was appointed, in 42 B.O., one of the commissioners to superintend the
distribution of lands in North Italy to the veteran troops, and about
this time he probably did good service for Vergil. Assuming the
guise of an Arcadian goatherd, Vergil sympathises with his friend,
who is supposed to be at once a Roman officer and a Shepherd of
Arcadia, in a poem that was probably intended rather as a compli-
mentary ode of gratitude than as a serious expression of condolence.

The Eclogue is modelled on the first Idyll of Theocritus.

Vv. 1—8. (ylo-ant me, Arethusa, to sing] of Gallus’ unhappy love for
Lycoris in pastoral strains, and my waterus* shall ever be pure.
