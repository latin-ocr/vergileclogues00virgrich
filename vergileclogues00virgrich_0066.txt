60 ECLOGUE 1v.

46. talia saecla ε probably vocative (“ ages such as these, run on’');
but some editors take it as accusative of extent in time, “run on
through such ages.’'

49. Iovis incrementum: either (l) “ progeny of Jove,” which suits
the context best, or (2) “germ of a future Jupiter,'’ which is more
in accord with the meaning of the word elsewhere.

50. convexo pondere: 223. “bencath (lit. owing to) the weight of
its vaulted dome.’' mundum ; as usual, the “ universe‚’' zze.. earth, sun,
stars, etc. ⁷

52. †adspice‚ laetentur ut omnia: if the v.l. laetantur is adopted,
ut laetentur must be regarded as an independent sentence, not as an
indirect question, depending on adspice. The indicative is quite
common in such an idiom 3 cp. nonne vides croceos ut Tmolus odore-3,
India mittit ebur, ‘⁶ seest thou not how Tmolus sends fragrant saffron
and India ivory.'’

54. sat dicere ε the infinitive here denotes purpose, a use not allow-
able in prose. The infinitive is originally a case, usually a dative 01
locative, of an abstract verbal noun, and as such came to be used in
Greek and (chiefly by poets) in Latin as an indeclinable noun in
almost any case relation. Here it is equivalent to a dative of work
contemplated‚ “ sufficient for singing.’' Other instances of this
infinitive of purpose are pecu-§² eqit altas visere mentes, ‘⁶' he drove his
herd to visit lofty mountains,” and fraqe-§³ consumere nati, ‘⁶ born to
devour the erops.''

55. non . . . nec : such pleonasm of negatives is commoner in
Greek than in Latin.

57. Orphei z dative singular Greek form.

58. Arcadia iudice : ablative of attendant circumstance, “with
Arcadia for judge.’' Arcadia was the native land of Pan, and so
might be expected to favour him.'’

60. risu: instrumental ablative, “ with a smile.” Some editors
make it refer to the mother, “by lter smile.”

62. †cui: another reading is qvi, “they who have not smiled upon
their parentS,'' but (1) this would require the dat-ive parenti, and
(2) leuno, which takes up the relative is singular
