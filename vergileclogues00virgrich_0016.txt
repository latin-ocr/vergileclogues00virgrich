whether they are imitations of Theocritus; and if they are,
they fall far short of their model.

It is certain that 'Vergil was well read iu Alexandrian

form and plan of Theocritus' pastorals sprang directly from
the nature of his subject-matter, with Vergil they generally
became a mere literary fiction, a conventional dress, which

imitations of Theocritus he himself masquerades under the

The Theocritean dress and the scenery hallowed by poetic
associations would appeal to educated readers of the time
