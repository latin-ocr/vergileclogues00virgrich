EOLOGUE x. 27

55. Meanwhile I will mingle with the nymphs and roam
over Maenalus, or Ι will hunt fieroe boars. Not any oold
shall keep me from besetting the glades of Parthenius
with hounds. Already I seem to see myself walking amid
rocks and eohoing groves 3 Ι feel a desire to shoot Cydonian
shafts from a Parthian bow. As if 811011 8111118 88 111888

’ would be a remedy for my mad passion, or that god would

188111 10 show compassion to men’s woes! Now again I
care not for the wood-nymphs nor even for songs3 again,
even ye woods, farewell. Our efforts cannot change him,

not though in midwinter we should drink of the Hebrus*

and endure snows of Sithonia in slushy winter time3 not
though, when the 118111 18 dried up and dying on the tall
81111, we should drive about 1118 1100118 of the Aethiopians
beneath 1118 8181 of Cancer. All things Love conquers:
181 118, 100, yield 10 Love.

This will 118 enough, ye goddesses of Pieria, for your
poet's song, while he sits and weaves a basket of slender
marsh-mallow-twigs; you will make this of 1118 greatest
worth in Gallus' eyes, Gallus for whom my love grows each
hour, 88 much as in early spring the green alder shoots
alost. Let us rise: shade is wont to harm the singer3 the
juniper shade does harm3 the shades are bad even for
crops. Gro home, ye have eaten your fill, go, my goats, the
evening star is rising.
