71. barbarus: perhaps some Gallie or German recruit from a
Roman legion.

72. his ε observe the emphatic position of this word.

73. insere nunc : mmm is often used with an imperative to add
ironical force. ordine: the vines were planted in regular rows, so
that the ground between them might bc turned up.

76. pendere: from below they would seem to be hanging on the
sides of the steep rock.

7 7. me pascente : ablative absolute, “ with me to tend you.”

79. †poteras requiescere: (1) “you might have rested.'’ Meliboeus
has just declared his intention to go, so it is only polite in Tityrus
to assume he means what he says. The indicative of possum is com-
monly used where we might expect the subjunctive in the apodoses

of conditional sentences—ey. here, poteras (si non aliter statuisses), f

where we must supply the protasis 3 cp. neque sustineri- poterant, ni
cohortes ..s-e obiecissent, “nor could they have been withstood‚ if the
cohorts had not inte1·posed.'’ The indicative of the verbs debeo, decet.
and oportet, is similarly used. Some texts erroneously give leae . . .
noete and poteris.

81. molles: “mealy.'’ pressi . . . laetis: “checse.''

ECLOGUE ΙΙ.
PREFACE.

The idea of this Eclogue and many expressions in it are taken from
the eleventh Idyll of Theocritus. Alexis is by some ancient authori·
ties said to represent a boy named Alexander given to Vergil by
Pollio. The scenery evidently refers to Sicily, which is mentioned in
v. 21. This Eclogue was probably the first that Vergil wrote.

Vv. 1-18. A shepltercl named Corydon, wlco loz-ed tlte beautiful
youth Alanis, is introduced as complevisti& ‘gf hamat-auritas indiffer-
enoe to Itis suit and preference for thei}- master Iollas.

1. ardebat Alexim: a striking example of the usage explained in
the note on I. 10. Ardere, properly ⁴⁶ to be warm‚’' here means “ to
burn with love for.²'

2. delicias: “favourite,'' the abstract delieiae being often used
thus with concrete force. nec, quid speraret, habebat : the use of
quid (not quod) shows that we have a dependent question. The
meaning may be either (1) ‘⁴ and he knew not why he should hope,'’
210. he “knew no ground for hope‚” or (2) “he knew not what to
hope for.'’ Haben, like ἔχω, sometimes means “1 knoxv‚'' a usage
found in good prose.
