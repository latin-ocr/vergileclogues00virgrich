INTRODUCTION. 13

which are admitted by competent critics to be of surpassing
beauty. One of the finest of these, a passage which
Macaulay thought the finest lines in all Vergil, is the
description of a boy's love at first sight, in Eclogue VIII.
37-41. In such passages especially the language'seems to
flow naturally from the thought: language was not yet
studied for its own sake3 it had not yet become an impedi-
ment to the clearness of thought: the tyranny of language
over thought grew up after the Golden Age of Roman
Literature had passed.

ξ 6. From early Latin scholars we learn that the Ecloques
nates were written during the three years 42*39 Bc.
⁸ From internal evidence we are able to fix with
tolerable certainty the date of a few of the Eclogues. The
reference to Pollio's consulship in the fourth Eclogue (v. ll)
fixes the date for 40 B.c. The eiyhth was sent to Pollio
when he was on his way home from Dalmatia in 39 B.O.‚ and
was clearly written in that year. The tenth is expressly
stated in the first line to have been the last, and, according
to the dates fixed by early Latin scholars given above, must
belong to 39 B.O. The first, niotth and sioeth refer to the
loss of Vergil's paternal estate and its restoration, and these
three would fall within the year 41 and possibly part of
40 B.O. That the fifth is earlier than the second and third
is proved by the reference in V. 86, 87, to the latter two
poems. The reference in the ninth (v. 19) to the fifth
(v. 40) shows that the former is of later date than the
latter. Thus Eclogues II.‚ III. and V. come before
Eclogue IX., and with them may be placed Eclogue VII„
owing to its similarity of style.
These results may be briefly tabulated thus :—

Eclogues II.‚ ΙΙΙ., V. and probably VII. . . 42 B.c.
Eclogues 1.,1X.‚V1.·. . . . 41—ear1y in 40 Bo.
Eclogue IV.. . . . . . . 40 ΒΩ.
Eclogues V111„X. . . . . . . 39 Β.ο.

§ 7. The meti es used by the classica] Latin poets are
all of Greek origin, and depend entirely on
quantity, te. on the length of syllables. The
metro of the Ecloyues is the Dactylic Hexameter‚ in which

Metro.
