narrates the song of the shepherd Damon, with Alphesi-
boeus' reply. Damon laments the faithlessness of his lady-
love Nysa, who had deserted him for Mopsus, and threatens
to plunge in the sea and drown himself. Alphesiboeus
replies with a description of magio rites and spells used to
win back the love of Daphnis,

Eclogue IX. An allegorical poem touching the loss and
restoration of the lands of Vergil's father. Moeris, who is
carrying some kids to market for his master Menalcas
(i.e. Vergil), is accosted by the shepherd Lycidas, and tells
him *how he and his master had been ejected from their
farm. Lycidas expresses his surprise, as he had heard
that Menalcas' poems had procured its restoration. He
consoles Moeris, and they repeat selections of Menalcas'
poetry.

Eclogue X. The last Eclogue is another distinctly alle-
gorical poem. Assuming the guise of an Arcadian goat-
herd, Vergil introduces us to the Roman commander O.
Asinius Gallus, who is represented as the Theocritean
Daphnis dying of unrequited love. This Daphnis sings
to Arcadian shepherds his complaint of Lycoris' cruel
desertion, in faultlessly beautiful verse. Then Vergil comes
back suddenly from the scenes of pastoral fancy to call
Gallus by his real name, and express a hope that the
poem will please him.

ᾧ 5. The chief merit of the Ecloyzoes lies in the exquisite
St le style in which the poet expresses his thoughts.
y ⁰ Never before had the Latin language been
made to give forth such melodious music. In Vergil’s
hands the hexameter became a flexible vehicle for poetica]
thought of every kind, whether heroic or didactic or of
the lighter moods of love. The diction, elaborated with art
that conceals art, appears exactly to adapt itself to the
thought and the exigencies of metre, and so gives a pleasant
feeling of satisfaction to the artistic sense, a feeling which
is less intense than the pleasure one experiences from the
ηαϊυεῑὲ and childish simplicity of Homer and much of
Theocritus, but is nevertheless genuine and deep. And all
this is particularly true of some passages in the Εοίορῑιεε,
