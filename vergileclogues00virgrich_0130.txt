beecheS, 111050 tall and shady 11005. There, quite alone, 10
1110 hills and 1110 woods he would hurl forth in bootless
passion arbless complaints like these: “O hard-hearted
Alexis, care you nough‘o for my lays? Have you no pitzy
for 11102 Yon will drive me ab last] 10 (100111.” Now even

brakes 51101101· 017011 the green lizards, and for 1110 reapers
wearied by scorching heaf, Thestylis is bruising together

a 111110 while ago on 1110 shore I saw my image, when 1110
sea was standing mobionless, becalmed by 1110 windS. With
