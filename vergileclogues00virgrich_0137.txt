ECLOGUE 1v. 11

1110 sea with their ships, to gird their towns with walls, and
to cleave furrows in the earth. There shall be then a second
Tiphys, and a second Argo to carry chosen heroes3 there
shall be also a second war and yet again shall a great

Achilles be sent to Troy.
37. Afterwards, when at length mature years have made

thee a man, even the merchant shall quit the sea, nor shall
the ship of pine barter merchandise. All lands shall pro-
duce all things. The earth will not endure the harrow, nor
the vinoyard the pruning-hook 3 now, too, the sturdy plough-
man shall loose the yokes from the bullocks' neckS, and
wool shall not be taught 10 counterfeit varied colours‚ but
of himself 111 1110 meadows shall the ram change his fieece
now to a sweetly blushing purple, now 10 a saffron-yellow,
and of its own accord shall scarlet clo'the the grazing lambs.

46. “ Ages such as ye run on 1 '' said the Parcae to their
spindles in accord with the fixed will of the fateS. Oh enter
on thine honours—soon will the time be nigh at hand—
thou loved offspring of the gods, great progeny of Jove!
Look thou upon 1110 universe as it totters beneath the
weight of its vaulted dome, ancl on the earth and the
expanse of ocean and the depths of the firmament3 look
how all things are rejoicing in the age that is about to
come!

Oh may the last years of my life endure long enough, and
may Ι have breath, even so much as shall suffice 10 1011
thy deedsl Then shall I be surpassed in song neither by
Thracian Orpheus nor by Linus, though the one were helped
by his mother, the other by his sire-Orpheus by Calliope,
Linus by fair Apollo. VVere even Pan 10 try a match
with me, and were Arcadia judge, even Pan would own
himself beaten, though Arcadia were judge.

Begin, little child, with a 3111110 10 recognise thy mother :
10 thy mother ten months have brought long wearineSS.
Regin, little child3 him, upon whom parents have not
smiled‚ a god deems not worthy of his table, a goddess
deems not worthy of her love.
