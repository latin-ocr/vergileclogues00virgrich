24 VERGIL.

along with yourself‚ Menalcas? Who would sing of
nymphs‘l Who would strew the ground with fiowering
grasses or canopy the springs with verdant shade‘.l Or who
would sing us the songs I silently gathered up in secret
from you the other day, when you were hurrying to our
darling, Amaryllis? “ Tityrus, till Ι 'return—the way is
short—seed my goats, and when they are pastured takd
