26 VERGIL.

thou asliamed o‘t' thy flock, heavenly poet: fair Adonis also
pastuied sheep by the river 's side—and. the shepherd came,
and the weary swinehe rds came, dripping from 13116 steep-
ing of winter acorns came Menalcas. All ask, “VVhence
that passion of 13111116. Ῥ’ Apollo came. “,Why Gallus, so
nial. ‘¹³' said he3 “thy love, Lycoris, through snows andl
through the fierce camp, has gone after another.’ ' There?
came, too, Silvanus, with a rural garland on his brow‚
nodding the flowering fennel and giant lilies. Pan, the god.
